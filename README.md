# Final Project

## Standard Workflow

 1. Set up the project: `bin/setup`
 1. Start the web server by running `bin/server`.
 1. Navigate to your live application.
 1. As you work, remember to navigate to `/git` and **commit often as you work.**
 1. Make new branches freely to experiment! _Especially_ before starting on a new task.
